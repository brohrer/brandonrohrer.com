<p>
Creating a web page is only the beginning. The business of sharing it with
the world has a lot of moving parts and a lot of choke points.
If an ISP decides to stop traffic to your website or if your hosting platform
goes bankrupt there isn't a lot you can do about it. But what you can do is
have a solid Plan B &mdash; being ready to spin up another copy of your
website on another server. A server that you control, or at least a server
of your choosing.
</p>

<p>
This guide shows one way to do set up your own hosting.
It's not the only way or even the best way.
But it is at least a path through the desert.
</p>

<h2><a id="Choose-a-computer"></a><a href="#Choose-a-computer">Choose a computer</a></h2>

<p>
There are lots of cloud providers out there, of all sizes and in a lot
of difference countries. Pick one. Or use a computer you have at home,
if your ISP will let you get away with serving a website from it.
</p>

<p>
I chose <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> because I had
heard some good things about it and because it wasn't AWS.
The first step there is to create an account on Digital Ocean by setting up a "Team",
even if it's just you.
</p>

<h2><a id="Add-an-ssh-key"></a><a href="#Add-an-ssh-key">Add an ssh key</a></h2>

<p>
Create a public/private key pair on your local machine. Follow the
Digital Ocean menus to
</p>

<p>
<code>Settings</code> -> <code>Security</code> -> <code>Add SSH Key</code> 
</p>

<p>
and follow the instructions there
<a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/upload-ssh-keys/">and here are some related docs
</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's recommended to create a passphrase for your keys, but don't forget
to write it down.
</p>

<h2><a id="Create-a-Digital-Ocean-droplet"></a><a href="#Create-a-Digital-Ocean-droplet">Create a Digital Ocean droplet</a></h2>

<p>
Individual computers within Digital Ocean are called droplets.
(Clever, right?)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/getting-started/quickstart/#create-droplets">There's a good walkthrough</a>
in the DO docs, and the UI is not bad.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, make sure to add your ssh key during the creation process.
And note the IP address.
</p>

<p>
I chose a small box with 1 GB Memory, 25 GB Disk in the NYC data center
running Ubuntu 24.04. Its IP address is <code>138.197.69.146</code>.
</p>

<h2><a id="ssh-in-from-a-terminal"></a><a href="#ssh-in-from-a-terminal">ssh in from a terminal</a></h2>

<p>
<pre>
ssh root@138.197.69.146
</pre>
</p>

<p>
and provide your passphrase if you have one.
</p>

<p>
<img alt="The console messages in response to an ssh to root
" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/hosting/root_login.png">
</p>

<p>
From this point, most of the steps will be the same, whether you're on Digital
Ocean, another service provider, or a laptop, as long as it's
running Linux. 
</p>

<h2><a id="Create-a-user"></a><a href="#Create-a-user">Create a user</a></h2>

<p>
It's possible to work as <code>root</code> all the time, but it's just too easy to
accidentally do something destructive. Future you will thank you if you
create a non-root user. My preferred username is <code>brohrer</code> but sub yours
in below.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo adduser brohrer
</pre>
</p>

<p>
and then create a password.
</p>

<p>
Your new user will definitely want to do root-level things though, so
it will need to have <code>sudo</code> permissions.
</p>

<p>
Add the new user to the sudo-ers group
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo usermod -aG sudo brohrer
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Then switch into the new user role
</p>

<p>
<pre>
su - brohrer
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Test whether sudo works for you
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You'll be prompted for your sudo password, which is the password for
the user you just created. If it works, you'll see a dialog box like this
</p>

<p>

<h2><a id="Install-the-Nginx-web-server-"></a><a href="#Install-the-Nginx-web-server-">Install the Nginx web server </a></h2>

<p>
Next is installing some web server software. There are a few popular ones,
like <a href="https://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>,
<a href="https://nginx.org/en/index.html">nginx</a>,
and <a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy</a>.
I went with nginx, because it's realtively lightweight and exposes some
of the wiring, but they're all good, and there are people who love them all.
</p>

<p>
From <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04">Digital Ocean docs</a>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Here are some <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-4-managing-the-nginx-process">useful commands for managing nginx
</a>.
We're not going to use them yet, but we'll be back soon.
</p>

<h2><a id="Set-up-UFW"></a><a href="#Set-up-UFW">Set up UFW</a></h2>

<p>
Before turning things on, it's helpful to set up defenses.
The Web is really wild. Hostile and unhinged. A firewall gives you a protective
barrier, a first line of defense for filtering out that noise.
</p>

<p>
Linux's is a great tool for this Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW).
The <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands">DO docs</a>
and <a href="https://thelinuxcode.com/ufw-firewall-allow-ssh/">this page</a> give a good
onramp, but the basics are all below.
</p>

<p>
<code>status</code> shows whether it's up and running.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw status
</pre>
</p>

<p>
It's not because we haven't turned it on.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Status: inactive
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Look at the list of apps we could add.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw app list
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Before you do anything else, allow <code>ssh</code> (port 22). If you don't, you can forget
and end up turning on a firewall that blocks all ssh traffic. That makes it
very hard to ssh into the machine to fix it. Ask me how I know.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Now you can turn on the firewall
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw enable
</pre>
</p>

<p>
And then add nginx. This tells the firewall to allow traffic in and out
associated with the nginx server. <code>Nginx full</code> allows both http (port 80)
and https (port 443).
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
and verify that it's running.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo ufw status
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Status: active<br>
To                         Action      From
&mdash;                         &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;      &mdash;&mdash;
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a id="Start-up-nginx"></a><a href="#Start-up-nginx">Start up nginx</a></h2>

<p>
From the command line
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl start nginx
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Verify the status.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl status nginx
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Mine responds like this.
</p>

<p>

<p>
The ultimate test comes from throwing the web address of the server
into a browser <code>http://138.197.69.146</code>. It shows
this page if all has gone well
</p>

<p>
<img alt="an Nginx welcome screen, evidence that Nginx was properly installed
" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/hosting/nginx_welcome.png">
</p>

<p>
The html file for this page is <code>/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html</code>.
You can dump any other html files you want to share in this location too.
I added a few others, for instance <code>pendulum.html</code>, which can be accessed
at <code>http://138.197.69.146/pendulum.html</code>.
</p>

<h2><a id="What's-next"></a><a href="#What's-next">What's next</a></h2>

<p>
And that's a web server! You can spin up a new one any time you like
in the time it takes to walk through this guide.
</p>

<p>
In the next installment we'll walk through how to tie all this to a domain name
like <code>mycoolwebsite.com</code>. That has the added benefit of giving you a consistent
home base for your material, rather than having to share a new IP address
every time you switch servers.
