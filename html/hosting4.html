In parts one through three, we
<a href="hosting.html">set up a web server</a>,
<a href="hosting2.html">connected it to a domain name</a>, and
<a href="hosting3.html">instituted some basic security</a>.
Now comes the fun part! The web server is humming along doing its thing,
and we can watch and admire, making little improvements here and there.
It’s not required, but for some, this is part of the payoff.

<p>
It can be counterintuitive that a thing made out of code should need
ongoing attention and care. On the surface it seems like it should be
self-sufficient, like a wall made of stones.
We put the pieces in place where we want them and when we’re happy with it, we stop.
It's all silicon and bits after all, why should it need watching?
</p>

<p>
The bigger picture, though, is that the web server operates in a world
that’s always changing. Software updates cause tools to behave differently.
Edits happen to the HTML and other content we host.
There are dramatic changes in who is trying to reach the content
and for what purposes. There can be outages, policy changes, and any
number of second-order effects in the wider world that can make our
web server stop operating the way we want. So on that scale a web server
starts to more closely resemble a vegetable garden&mdash;something growing,
decaying, and very much a product of the environment that it's in.

This page is my notes on care and feeding practices I've found helpful
and enjoyable. I'm not an expert on this, and this is not authoritative
by any means. But I put it here in case you find it helpful. If I missed
anything, or got it egregiously wrong, please let me know.

<p>
In these examples I'm working with a
<a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean droplet</a> at <code>138.197.69.146</code>
hosting the content for the domain <code>brandonrohrer.com</code>. It's running
an nginx server on Ubuntu 24.04.
My local machine is a MacBook pro, where I'm working
from the Terminal. My go-to text editor is vim, but you can use nano
instead.  Adjust the snippets below for your situation.

<h2><a id="Browse-the-logs"></a><a href="#Browse-the-logs">Browse the logs</a></h2>

<p>
I've been curious about self-hosting for a while, but the thing that pushed
me over the edge into migrating off Netlify was a desire to
see which IP addresses were visiting which pages when. This information
is all in the logs.
</p>

<p>
Because I set up a server block specifically for my domain,
the log files live in <code>/var/log/nginx/brandonrohrer.com/</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>access.log</code> has the main logs, and <code>error.log</code> keeps a log of when
things go poorly.
</p>

<p>
To browse the logs
<pre>
cat /var/log/nginx/brandonrohrer.com/access.log
</pre>
</p>

<p>
which gives something like
</p>

<p>
or
</p>

<p>
<pre>
cat /var/log/nginx/brandonrohrer.com/error.log

<p>
which gives errors like

Scanning through these for a few minutes can reveal some fascinating patterns,
a few of which will pop up later in the post.
</p>

<h2><a id="Check-for-missed-pages"></a><a href="#Check-for-missed-pages">Check for missed pages</a></h2>

<p>
With a slight tweak, this command can pull out only the logs containing
a "404", the http status code for Page Not Found. (It actually pulls out every
log that has a 404 anywhere in it, but the majority of these are 
page not found entries.)
</p>

<p>
<pre>
cat /var/log/nginx/brandonrohrer.com/access.log | grep 404
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This slice of the logs reveals files I don't have, but are normal to
look for, like <code>/favicon.ico</code> and  <code>/.well-known/traffic-advice</code>. It
also showed mistakes like a misspelled filename or a missing image.
</p>

<h2><a id="Catch-pages-without-the-<code>.html</code>"></a><a href="#Catch-pages-without-the-<code>.html</code>">Catch pages without the <code>.html</code></a></h2>

<p>
One of the first surprises I got was looking 404's in the logs was
that visitors coming to my page looking for a page called
<code>transformers.html</code> would be turned away if they only put in <code>transformers</code>.
There were a lot of 404 log entries for misses of this sort. This was
a bummer. These were people who are trying to visit my website but
are being denied on a technicality.
</p>

<p>
Luckily nginx makes it straightforward to fix this.
I edited the file containing the server block
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/brandonrohrer.com
</pre>
</p>

<p>
and changed the line that read
</p>

<p>
<pre>
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
so that it read
</p>

<p>
<pre>
try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
When nginx parses the webpage being requested, <code>$uri</code> is the variable
containing the page name. The modified line instructs the server to
first try the exact page name requested, then to try it with a <code>.html</code>
tagged onto the end, then to try it with a backslash on the end, and if
none of those turn anything up, return a 404 page not found error.
</p>

<p>
After making this change (or any of the other changes described below)
it's important to first test that we didn't goober anything up
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo nginx -t
</pre>
</p>

<p>
and if our change passes the test and nginx is happy with it, then restart
nginx so that the change takes effect
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo systemctl restart nginx
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a id="Redirects"></a><a href="#Redirects">Redirects</a></h2>

<p>
In addition to accounting for missing html extensions, I've found it helpful
to automatically expand short names into longer ones.
For example, <code>numba</code> automatically redirects to <code>numba_tips.html</code>.
It's also good for fixing typos in published pages. I've
redirected <code>statistics_resources.html</code> to <code>stats_resources.html</code> because
I shared the wrong URL in a publication.
</p>

<p>
I also use it as a link shortener, so that <code>fnc</code> actually points to a pdf
in a codeberg repository and <code>bp</code> redirects to a video about
backpropagation on youtube. For the record, <code>brandonrohrer.com</code> is a
terrible domain name for a link shortener. I also picked up <code>tyr.fyi</code>
as a shorter domain for when I want erally short links.

<p>
Redirects are implemented in the domain's server block.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/brandonrohrer.com
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Add a line like this within the server block.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
rewrite ^/numba$ https://brandonrohrer.com/httyr/numba_tips.html permanent;
