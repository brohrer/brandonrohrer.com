In <a href="hosting.html">part one</a> of this series we set up a web server.
The next step is to make it act like a real website.
</p>

<h2><a id="Buy-a-domain-name"></a><a href="#Buy-a-domain-name">Buy a domain name</a></h2>

<p>
The first thing to do is to name it. 
Typing <code>http://192.0.2.146</code> to get to your content is impersonal,
boring, and impossible to remember. The name of a website is its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain name</a>.
For example, the domain name for English-language Wikipedia
is <code>en.wikipedia.org</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>org</code> is the top level domain (TLD).</li>
<li> <code>wikipedia</code> is the second level domain.</li>
<li> <code>en</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain">subdomain</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Top level domains come in two flavors, generic and country code.
Generic top level domains (gTLDs) include some you are familiar with,
like <code>.com</code> and <code>.org</code>, and a bunch you've probably never seen,
like <code>.anime</code> and <code>.tattoos</code>.
Country code top level domains (ccTLDs) are all two-letter
country codes taken
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1">ISO-3166</a>.
A few of the most common are <code>.uk</code> (United Kingdom),
<code>.de</code> (Germany), and <code>.cn</code> (China).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people will get creative with country codes and
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">repurpose them</a>.
The <code>.ai</code> (Antigua) ccTLD has been co-opted by a whole generation of
startups. Same for <code>.io</code> (British Indian Ocean Territory).
<code>.me</code> (Montenegro) is a fun one for personalized websites, and the US
state of Maine. <code>.it</code> (Italy) and <code>.to</code> (Tonga) are useful for spelling
English phrases and words like <code>this.is.it</code> and <code>p.ota.to</code>.
</p>

</figure>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">comprehesive list of TLDs
</a> has 1439 of them,
as of August 2025 so it's easy to get overwhelmed. If you get paralyzed
by choice, you're always safe going with dot com.
</p>

<p>
There’s a running joke that the most important part of any project
is choosing the right domain name. There’s another joke that 90% of
projects don’t get past choosing a domain name. It’s fun but not
critical. Put as much or as little thought into it as you want.
It's OK to make this all about you. And anyway, if insipration strikes
next month you can always buy another domain.
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few reputable domain registrars--places that can sell you a
domain name--and it's tough to go wrong. I get mine through
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, but other popular ones are
<a href="https://www.hostinger.com">Hostinger</a>,
<a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, and
<a href="https://porkbun.com/">porkbun</a>.
I found <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-domain-registrars">this TechRadar review
</a>
very helpful. You can go to one of these fine establishments and just
buy your domain name of choice, as long as someone else hasn't beat
you to it. It's so cool that with a few clicks and a few bucks you
can claim a a globally unique piece of real estate and start to build
your digital castle there. Trippy.
</p>

<h2><a id="Point-the-domain-to-your-web-server"></a><a href="#Point-the-domain-to-your-web-server">Point the domain to your web server</a></h2>

<p>
The next step is to inform the domain name servers (DNS) of the world
that your new domain name should point to your web server.
</p>

<p>
This most likely is something you can do through the company that sold you
your domain name. The Namecheap interface looks like this, and other domain
name brokers have a similar page.
</p>

<p>
<img alt="Adding Namecheap DNS records
" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/hosting/dns_records.png">
</p>

<p>
The important pieces of information here are
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Type</strong> This will be an "A record" (short for <strong>A</strong>dress). There are
a few other useful types but nothing that we need to worry about to get
started. A records establish the IPv4 address assoicated with the domain name.</li>
<li> <strong>Host</strong> This is the domain name being assigned. As a short hand,
<code>@</code> means "whatever domain name you just bought and are now setting up",
maybe something like <code>brandonrohrer.com</code>. <code>www</code> is also shorthand for 
<code>www.brandonrohrer.com</code>, just like <code>en</code> in this column would be
shorthand for <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> if we were setting up the Wikipedia page.</li>
<li> <strong>Value</strong> The IP address that the Host should be directed to. For us this
will be the IP address of the web server we just created.</li>
<li> <strong>TTL</strong> Time to live for this DNS record on the domain name servers before
they forget about it and have to ask again. "Automatic" is fine unti
you start doing fancy things with DNS.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The entries in this image will send any Internet user in the world who
puts <code>brandonrohrer.com</code> or <code>www.brandonrohrer.com</code> in their browser to 
<code>192.0.2.146</code>.
</p>

<p>
DNS is a big topic, and the details can bite you occassionally. If you
have a few minutes and a little curiosity, I recommend checking out
<a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/">How DNS works</a> by Julia Evans.
It is both ridiculously accessible and deeply informative.
Best $12 you will spend this week.
</p>

<h2><a id="Wait"></a><a href="#Wait">Wait</a></h2>

<p>
If your domain is brand new, then the DNS records you added may be available
quickly, but more often it can take up to 48 hours. DNSs hang on to
address records that they've read recently (DNS caching) and only ask
for updates after the TTL has expired. Unfortunately this can be
a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
You can check in on the process while waiting. There are several
command line invocations on Linux and MacOS that resolve a domain name.
After reassigning <code>e2eml.school</code> to <code>192.0.2.146</code> here were some
of the ways it showed up.
</p>

<h3><a id="<code>ping</code>"></a><a href="#<code>ping</code>"><code>ping</code></a></h3>

<p>
<pre>
ping e2eml.school
</pre>
</p>

<p>
gave me
</p>

<p>
<pre>
PING e2eml.school (192.0.2.146): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.0.2.146: icmp_seq=0 ttl=46 time=19.565 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.146: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=19.744 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.146: icmp_seq=2 ttl=46 time=22.920 ms
64 bytes from 192.0.2.146: icmp_seq=3 ttl=46 time=23.076 ms
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<code>ping</code> checks how long it takes to send a packet to the destination and
get a response. In the process it also reports the IP address that
the domain resolved to.
</p>

<h3><a id="<code>host</code>"></a><a href="#<code>host</code>"><code>host</code></a></h3>

<p>
<pre>
host e2eml.school
</pre>
</p>

<p>
gave me
</p>

<p>
<pre>
e2eml.school has address 192.0.2.146
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<code>host</code> directly resolves the IP address associated with the domain name.
It doesn't necessarily do this in the same way as <code>ping</code>. It can ask
different computers and programs. So it may give a different answer,
as the DNS record changes roll out to the rest of the DNSs.
</p>

<h3><a id="<code>nslookup</code>"></a><a href="#<code>nslookup</code>"><code>nslookup</code></a></h3>

<p>
<pre>
nslookup e2eml.school
</pre>
</p>

<p>
gave me
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Server:		2001:558:feed::1
Address:	2001:558:feed::1#53 <br>
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	e2eml.school
Address: 192.0.2.146
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The IP address appears here too. This method is also complementary to
<code>ping</code> and <code>host</code>. It can give a different answer.
</p>

<h3><a id="<code>dig</code>"></a><a href="#<code>dig</code>"><code>dig</code></a></h3>

<p>
<pre>
dig +noall +answer e2eml.school
</pre>
</p>

<p>
gave me
</p>

<p>
<pre>
e2eml.school.		1799	IN	A	192.0.2.146
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In yet another way it returns the IP address for the domain.
</p>

<p>
A convenient way to run bulk checks from a collection of places
around the world is from a
<a href="https://dnschecker.org">DNS checker website</a>.
</p>

<p>
<img alt="A DNS checker running e2eml.school from all over the world
" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brohrer/blog_images/refs/heads/main/hosting/dns_checker.png">
</p>

<p>
When all of these agree, that's a pretty good sign that the DNS record change
is complete.
But the ultimate test is to run and end to end verification.
Make some change to a <code>.html</code> file on the server and see whether it
shows up when you try to read that file in your browser. 
</p>

<h2><a id="Add-your-websites-from-a-repository"></a><a href="#Add-your-websites-from-a-repository">Add your websites from a repository</a></h2>

<p>
You can be done now if you want. You have the <code>http://</code> version
of your domain pointing to your IP address, and a place where you
can add all the html files you like. This next step, while optional,
can make it easier to develop web pages and track your changes.
</p>

<p>
Rather than have your web server be your source of truth for your web pages,
you can have your main copy live in a git repository. Then you just pull
this repository to your web server when you want to roll out edits or
new pages.
</p>

<p>
For convenience, name your git repository the same name as your domain
and put all the files in an <code>html</code> subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
<pre>
my.website.com
┗ html
  ┣ index.html
  ┣ ...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you're new to git and want to open the black box, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/04/25/new-zine--how-git-works-/">Julia Evans'
Wizard Zines</a>
is an amazing explainer.
There are
<a href="https://www.brandonrohrer.com/git_resources">some other helpful resources</a>
here, especially <a href="https://ohshitgit.com">Oh shit, git!</a> (
also available <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zines/oh-shit-git/">as a zine</a>
), the
repair kit in case things go off the rails.
</p>

<p>
If your repo is on GitHub, then you can put in to your server where
it needs to be with this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
cd /var/www/
sudo git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-domain.git
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Modify as necessary if you are using another git service.
</p>

<p>
Using the <code>http</code> version works great because the web server will be pull-only
and shouldn't need to mess around with keys or authorization because it's
not going to be making any changes.
And any time you make change to any of your files in the repository, you can
re-deploy it with 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
sudo git pull origin HEAD
</pre>
</p>

<h2><a id="Set-up-a-server-block"></a><a href="#Set-up-a-server-block">Set up a server block</a></h2>

<p>
To finish setting up nginx to use your web code from git, follow these
excellent instructions in
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04#step-5-setting-up-server-blocks-recommended">the Digital Ocean docs</a>
that do a better job than I can of walking you through this. There are a lot of
steps, but they are all copy/paste-able into your ssh console.
</p>

<p>
Putting all the files for your domain in its own directory like this referred
to as a server block. While you can just dump them all in the top level
<code>/var/www/html/</code> directory, this gives a little more structure to them.
And the really cool part is that you can repeat this for other
domain names if you want. No need to spin up another server instance
for each one.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you have a fully deployed website at <code>http://your-domain</code>.
The next post is going to change that into a <code>https://</code> and do some
other things to harden the security of your website and server.
It's a brutal world out there, and it pays to protect yourself.
</p>

<h2><a id="Deploy-changes"></a><a href="#Deploy-changes">Deploy changes</a></h2>

<p>
When you make edits or add pages the steps to deploy them are, first,
make sure the changes are reflected in the git repository. Then,
ssh into the server and run
</p>

<p>
<pre>
cd /var/www/your-domain
sudo git pull origin HEAD
</pre>
